# Countdown Timer
This is a simple countdown timer built with JavaScript. It allows you to set a countdown timer for any specific time and display the remaining time in minutes and seconds.

## Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code as a zip file. \
Open the project folder in your terminal or command prompt. \
Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. \
Run `npm start` to start the project in development mode. 
## Usage
Once the project is up and running, you can open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/` to view the timer. You can set the countdown timer by entering a specific time in the format of mm:ss in the input field and clicking the 'Start' button. The timer will then start counting down to zero and display the remaining time in minutes and seconds.
